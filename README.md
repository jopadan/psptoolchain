This program will automatically build and install the whole compiler and other tools used in the creation of homebrew software for the Sony PlayStation PortableÂ® videogame system.

## **ATENTION!**

If you're trying to install in your machine the **WHOLE PSP Development Environment** this is **NOT** the repo to use, you should use instead the [pspdev](https://github.com/pspdev/pspdev "pspdev") repo.

## What these scripts do

These scripts download (`git clone`) and install:

-   [psptoolchain-allegrex](https://github.com/pspdev/psptoolchain-allegrex "psptoolchain-allegrex")
-   [psptoolchain-extra](https://github.com/pspdev/psptoolchain-extra "psptoolchain-extra")

## Requirements

1.  Install gcc/clang, make, cmake, patch, git, texinfo, flex, bison, gettext, wget, gsl, gmp, mpfr, mpc, readline, libarchive, gpgme, bash, openssl and libtool if you don't have those.
We offer a script to help you for installing dependencies:

### Ubuntu/Debian, Fedora, OSX
```bash
sudo ./prepare.sh
```
[MacPorts]: http://www.macports.org/
[HomeBrew]: http://brew.sh/

2.  Ensure that you have enough permissions for managing PSPDEV location (default to `/usr/local/pspdev`, but you can use a different path). PSPDEV location MUST NOT have spaces or special characters in its path! PSPDEV should be an absolute path. On Unix systems, if the command `mkdir -p $PSPDEV` fails for you, you can set access for the current user by running commands:
```bash
export PSPDEV=/usr/local/pspdev
sudo mkdir -p $PSPDEV
sudo chown -R $USER: $PSPDEV
```

3.  Add this to your login script (example: `~/.bash_profile`)
    **Note:** Ensure that you have full access to the PSPDEV path. You can change the PSPDEV path with the following requirements: only use absolute paths, don't use spaces, only use Latin characters.
```bash
export PSPDEV=/usr/local/pspdev
export PATH=$PATH:$PSPDEV/bin
```

4.  Run toolchain.sh
```bash
./toolchain.sh
```
